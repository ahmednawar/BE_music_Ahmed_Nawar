Describe in a high level the solution you have in mind
>

What other data could you use to improve recommendations?
> 	Music related: 
		1- Simple: Artist, release date, language, country of origin
		2- Hard: Similar to Pandora, tonality, tempo, rhythm, vocal harmony
		3- Ratings by users, also not just like and dislike but they can assign a 'mood' to songs: happy, sad, depressing, relaxing, etc.
	User related:
		1- Each user gets a rank based on how many followers they have, time spent on site, how many songs they listen to
		2- The user can also choose their current mood


Assume a more real world situation where you could have more data you described above, and more time to implement, could you think of a possibly more efficient way to recommend?
>	1- Caching
	2- Binary heap of five

Assume you have more than one implementation of recommendations, how could you test which one is more effective using data generated by user actions?
>	how many songs reccomended were clicked, listened to more than one time, shared via fb, twitter, etc
